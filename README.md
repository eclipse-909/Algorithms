# ASSIGNMENT 3 NOTES!!!
* When running ./Assignment3.exe, you can pass the names of the graph files as arguments.  
* Running "./Assignment3.exe" by itself will use graphs1.txt by default.  
* Running "./Assignment3.exe graphs2.txt graphs3.txt" will use graphs2.txt and graphs3.txt,
but not graphs1.txt. You can include graphs1.txt in the args if you want to use it.  
* You can specify as many files as you want.  
* File paths must be relative to the working directory.  
* graphs2.txt and graphs3.txt are not included.
